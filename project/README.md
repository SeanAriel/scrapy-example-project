# The Scrapy project

The [`project`](./project) folder contains spiders, items and pipelines. The `scrapy.cfg` is the deployment configuration file for
our project. We don't need to touch it as long as we're running our spiders locally. So jump into that project
 directory.

To run the first spider, run `scrapy crawl tourdefrance1` in this directory.
